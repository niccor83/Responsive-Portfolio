                I am an aspiring full stack web developer. I am originally from Logan, Utah but I currently live in Davis County. 
                I am married and have three children. I enjoy watching movies, playing golf, riding motorcycles, mountain biking, 
                and spending time with my family. I have a bachelors degree in Management Information System from Utah State University, go Aggies!
                I currently work for Intermountain Healthcare as an Application Systems Technical Analyst. During my schooling I took a few classes
                in web development and really enjoyed them, ever since I have wanted to learn to code. I have always enjoyed art, 
                solving problems, being creative, and building things. I feel like web development gives me the opportunity to put all those things I enjoy
                into practice as well as giving me an opportunity to build upon my education. I am very excited to see where this journey will take me.
